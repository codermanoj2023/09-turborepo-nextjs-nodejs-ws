Initialising Turborepo template...
# My Turbo Repo
This is a monorepo managed by Turborepo. It contains multiple packages and applications that can be built and tested together.
## Getting Started
To get started with this monorepo, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codermanoj2023/08-turborepo-template-with-tailwind.git
    cd 07-turborepo-template
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4. After running the above command, you will get two Next.js URLs in the terminal:
   - `http://localhost:3000` 
   - `http://localhost:3001`
5. Open your browser and navigate to the URLs to see the applications running.
